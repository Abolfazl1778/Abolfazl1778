## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Abolfazl Abdollahi, but you can also call me "Adam" for convenience. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Molecular Genetics at Tarbiat Modares University (TMU) and have a strong passion for programming. I've been taking courses focused on Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence about a year now, which I aim to integrate into my work as a Bioinformatician. My goal is to leverage my coding skills to tackle complex challenges in biology and medicine.
Here I share my projects that showcase my skills in bioinformatics and programming, including data analysis, visualization, and algorithm development. Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss ideas!
